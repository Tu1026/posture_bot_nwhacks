# posture_bot

### Requirements
On your Raspberry Pi, you will need to install the following:
- Every pip install as detailed in the `requirements.txt`
- Tensorflow 2+, [instructions here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNRg2P8Vqqs)

You will also need access to a [Raspberry Pi Camera Module](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-with-picamera)!

> Note: due to time constraints, we have not tried building this project from scratch on a brand new Raspberry Pi image, so download at your own risk!

## Possible next steps
These are potential next steps/implementations of this project:
- Build dedicated hardware (ie. Pi compute module) for the porject
- Utilize a more well-trained model to provide better results about posture
- Provide more features to the Discord bot
